# Wine Quality Prediction using Bayesian Methods
This project applies Bayesian logistic regression to classify white wines into two categories:
High quality (Rating ≥ 7)
Not high quality (Rating ≤ 6)
Using Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we predict wine quality based on physicochemical properties such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol levels.

## Dataset
The dataset originates from Cortez et al. (2009) - "Modeling Wine Preferences by Data Mining from Physicochemical Properties."
It includes 5,000+ observations and 12 variables:
Independent Variables (e.g., acidity, pH, alcohol content, etc.)
Dependent Variable: Wine quality rating (converted to a binary classification)
